            <h3>Background</h3>

              Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in a Punjabi-Kashmiri family
              from Sialkot in the Punjab Province of British India (now in
              Pakistan).

            <h3>Early Education</h3>
            <p>
              Iqbal was four years old when he was sent to a mosque to receive
              instruction in reading the Qur'an.

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              Iqbal first became interested in national affairs in his youth. He
              received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his
              return from England in 1908.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and
              supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the Punjab
              Legislative Assembly from the Muslim district of Lahore, and
              defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.He supported the
              constitutional proposals presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim
              political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress
              and worked with Aga Khan and other Muslim leaders to mend the
              factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League. While
              in Lahore he was a friend of Abdul Sattar Ranjoor.

          <p>
            Iqbal's poetic works are written primarily in Persian rather than
            Urdu. Among his 12,000 verses of poetry, about 7,000 verses are in
            Persian.In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the
            Asrar-i-Khudi <em>اسرارِ خودی </em> (Secrets of the Self) in
            Persian.
          </p>
          <p>Iqbal's 1924 publication, the Payam-e-Mashriq پیامِ مشرق (The Message of the East), is closely connected to the West-östlicher Diwan by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. </p>
